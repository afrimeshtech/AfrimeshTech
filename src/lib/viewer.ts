 * Buying context for a *business* sourcing upstream, used by the partner

 * The same discovery surface serves everyone; only the tier changes, and the
 * tier decides both who you may buy from and whether you see retail or
 * wholesale prices. A shop owner browsing the public storefront is a consumer
 * at tier 5 paying retail. The same person inside their dashboard is an outlet
 * at tier 4 paying wholesale. Resolving that here keeps the distinction in one
 * place instead of being re-derived on every page.
